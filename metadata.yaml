description: The greater the windbag the greater the calamity. Henry James examines
  one of his favorite topics--the artist;s place in society--by profiling a "genius"
  who just can't seem to support himself. A dazzling intellectual and brilliant speaker,
  Mr. Saltram has become the most sought-after houseguest in England. But, as his
  intellectual labors slacken, it become sharper and harder to get him to leave. A
  wry, edgy comedy about the fine line between making art...and freeloading.
