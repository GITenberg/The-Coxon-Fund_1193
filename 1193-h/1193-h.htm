<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">They&rsquo;ve</span> got him for
life!&rdquo; I said to myself that evening on my way back to the
station; but later on, alone in the compartment (from Wimbledon
to Waterloo, before the glory of the District Railway) I amended
this declaration in the light of the sense that my friends would
probably after all not enjoy a monopoly of Mr. Saltram.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t pretend to have taken his vast measure on that first
occasion, but I think I had achieved a glimpse of what the
privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many persons in the
way of charges accepted.&nbsp; He had been a great experience,
and it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of
foreseeing how we should all, sooner or later, have the honour of
dealing with him as a whole.&nbsp; Whatever impression I then
received of the amount of this total, I had a full enough vision
of the patience of the Mulvilles.&nbsp; He was to stay all the
winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting from
the inevitable emphasis.&nbsp; These excellent people might
indeed have been content to give the circle of hospitality a
diameter of six months; but if they didn&rsquo;t say he was to
stay all summer as well it was only because this was more than
they ventured to hope.&nbsp; I remember that at dinner that
evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of some
queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of
supposing that he might be snatched from them by higher
bidders.&nbsp; At a later time they grew, poor dears, to fear no
snatching; but theirs was a fidelity which needed no help from
competition to make them proud.&nbsp; Wonderful indeed as, when
all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank Saltram, it was not
to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in their way still
more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could easily be
encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find
remarkable conveniences.</p>
<p>They had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and
there had been an implication in Adelaide&rsquo;s
note&mdash;judged by her notes alone she might have been thought
silly&mdash;that it was a case in which something momentous was
to be determined or done.&nbsp; I had never known them not be in
a &ldquo;state&rdquo; about somebody, and I dare say I tried to
be droll on this point in accepting their invitation.&nbsp; On
finding myself in the presence of their latest discovery I had
not at first felt irreverence droop&mdash;and, thank heaven, I
have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative in Mr.
Saltram&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; I saw, however&mdash;I hasten to
declare it&mdash;that compared to this specimen their other
phoenixes had been birds of inconsiderable feather, and I
afterwards took credit to myself for not having even in primal
bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of the man.&nbsp;
He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it&mdash;it
dazzles me still.&nbsp; It dazzles me perhaps even more in
remembrance than in fact, for I&rsquo;m not unaware that for so
rare a subject the imagination goes to some expense, inserting a
jewel here and there or giving a twist to a plume.&nbsp; How the
art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the art of
portraiture had only the canvas!&nbsp; Nature, in truth, had
largely rounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes
holds her breath, this is because the voice that comes back was
really golden.</p>
<p>Though the great man was an inmate and didn&rsquo;t dress, he
kept dinner on this occasion waiting, and the first words he
uttered on coming into the room were an elated announcement to
Mulville that he had found out something.&nbsp; Not catching the
allusion and gaping doubtless a little at his face, I privately
asked Adelaide what he had found out.&nbsp; I shall never forget
the look she gave me as she replied:
&ldquo;Everything!&rdquo;&nbsp; She really believed it.&nbsp; At
that moment, at any rate, he had found out that the mercy of the
Mulvilles was infinite.&nbsp; He had previously of course
discovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners
were soign&eacute;s.&nbsp; Let me not indeed, in saying this,
neglect to declare that I shall falsify my counterfeit if I seem
to hint that there was in his nature any ounce of
calculation.&nbsp; He took whatever came, but he never plotted
for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have
been so little of a parasite.&nbsp; He had a system of the
universe, but he had no system of sponging&mdash;that was quite
hand-to-mouth.&nbsp; He had fine gross easy senses, but it was
not his good-natured appetite that wrought confusion.&nbsp; If he
had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with our dinners,
and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.&nbsp; I
make free in these connexions with the plural possessive because
if I was never able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with
still bigger houses and simpler charities, I met, first and last,
every demand of reflexion, of emotion&mdash;particularly perhaps
those of gratitude and of resentment.&nbsp; No one, I think, paid
the tribute of giving him up so often, and if it&rsquo;s
rendering honour to borrow wisdom I&rsquo;ve a right to talk of
my sacrifices.&nbsp; He yielded lessons as the sea yields
fish&mdash;I lived for a while on this diet.&nbsp; Sometimes it
almost appeared to me that his massive monstrous failure&mdash;if
failure after all it was&mdash;had been designed for my private
recreation.&nbsp; He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the
history of that experience would take me too far.&nbsp; This is
not the large canvas I just now spoke of, and I wouldn&rsquo;t
have approached him with my present hand had it been a question
of all the features.&nbsp; Frank Saltram&rsquo;s features, for
artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be
gathered.&nbsp; Their name is legion, and this is only one, of
which the interest is that it concerns even more closely several
other persons.&nbsp; Such episodes, as one looks back, are the
little dramas that made up the innumerable facets of the big
drama&mdash;which is yet to be reported.</p>
<h2><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is furthermore remarkable that
though the two stories are distinct&mdash;my own, as it were, and
this other&mdash;they equally began, in a manner, the first night
of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back from
Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London,
for the very thrill of it, I could only walk home.&nbsp; Walking
and swinging my stick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George
Gravener, and George Gravener&rsquo;s story may be said to have
begun with my making him, as our paths lay together, come home
with me for a talk.&nbsp; I duly remember, let me parenthesise,
that it was still more that of another person, and also that
several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second
chapter.&nbsp; I had much to say to him, none the less, about my
visit to the Mulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I
was at any rate so amusing that for long afterwards he never
encountered me without asking for news of the old man of the
sea.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t said Mr. Saltram was old, and it was to
be seen that he was of an age to outweather George
Gravener.&nbsp; I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and
Gravener was staying at his brother&rsquo;s empty house in Eaton
Square.&nbsp; At Cambridge, five years before, even in our
devastating set, his intellectual power had seemed to me almost
awful.&nbsp; Some one had once asked me privately, with blanched
cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left
standing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It leaves itself!&rdquo; I could recollect
devoutly replying.&nbsp; I could smile at present for this
remembrance, since before we got to Ebury Street I was struck
with the fact that, save in the sense of being well set up on his
legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.&nbsp; The
universe he laid low had somehow bloomed again&mdash;the usual
eminences were visible.&nbsp; I wondered whether he had lost his
humour, or only, dreadful thought, had never had any&mdash;not
even when I had fancied him most Aristophanesque.&nbsp; What was
the need of appealing to laughter, however, I could enviously
enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to
measurement?&nbsp; Mr. Saltram&rsquo;s queer figure, his thick
nose and hanging lip, were fresh to me: in the light of my old
friend&rsquo;s fine cold symmetry they presented mere success in
amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.&nbsp; Already, at
hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary as
if he were fifty and popular.&nbsp; In my scrap of a
residence&mdash;he had a worldling&rsquo;s eye for its futile
conveniences, but never a comrade&rsquo;s joke&mdash;I sounded
Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to
note that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my
enlivenment.&nbsp; As he had never before heard of the personage
it took indeed the form of impatience of the preposterous
Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like mine, had had its origin in
an early, a childish intimacy with the young Adelaide, the fruit
of multiplied ties in the previous generation.&nbsp; When she
married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much
more amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost
one.&nbsp; We reacted in different ways from the form taken by
what he called their deplorable social action&mdash;the form (the
term was also his) of nasty second-rate gush.&nbsp; I may have
held in my &lsquo;for int&eacute;rieur&rsquo; that the good
people at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at
them I couldn&rsquo;t help taking the opposite line, for I
already felt that even should we happen to agree it would always
be for reasons that differed.&nbsp; It came home to me that he
was admirably British as, without so much as a sociable sneer at
my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of my little
French library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve never seen the fellow, but
it&rsquo;s clear enough he&rsquo;s a humbug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear &lsquo;enough&rsquo; is just what it
isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;if it only
were!&rdquo;&nbsp; That ejaculation on my part must have been the
beginning of what was to be later a long ache for final frivolous
rest.&nbsp; Gravener was profound enough to remark after a moment
that in the first place he couldn&rsquo;t be anything but a
Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his
fascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend
retorted that there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that
I might depend upon discovering&mdash;since I had had the levity
not already to have enquired&mdash;that my shining light
proceeded, a generation back, from a Methodist
cheesemonger.&nbsp; I confess I was struck with his insistence,
and I said, after reflexion: &ldquo;It may be&mdash;I admit it
may be; but why on earth are you so sure?&rdquo;&mdash;asking the
question mainly to lay him the trap of saying that it was because
the poor man didn&rsquo;t dress for dinner.&nbsp; He took an
instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve an infallible hand for frauds.&nbsp; All their
geese are swans.&nbsp; They were born to be duped, they like it,
they cry for it, they don&rsquo;t know anything from anything,
and they disgust one&mdash;luckily perhaps!&mdash;with Christian
charity.&rdquo;&nbsp; His vehemence was doubtless an accident,
but it might have been a strange foreknowledge.&nbsp; I forget
what protest I dropped; it was at any rate something that led him
to go on after a moment: &ldquo;I only ask one
thing&mdash;it&rsquo;s perfectly simple.&nbsp; Is a man, in a
given case, a real gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real gentleman, my dear fellow&mdash;that&rsquo;s so
soon said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so soon when he isn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; If they&rsquo;ve
got hold of one this time he must be a great rascal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might feel injured,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;if I
didn&rsquo;t reflect that they don&rsquo;t rave about
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll grant that
he&rsquo;s a gentleman,&rdquo; Gravener presently added,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll admit that he&rsquo;s a scamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which to admire most, your logic or
your benevolence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend coloured at this, but he didn&rsquo;t change the
subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did they pick him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they were struck with something he had
published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can fancy the dreary thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries
and difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of course wasn&rsquo;t to be endured, so they
jumped at the privilege of paying his debts!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and I reminded my
visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they were
neither idiots nor millionaires.&nbsp; What they mainly aimed at
was reuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
expecting to hear he has basely abandoned her,&rdquo; Gravener
went on, at this, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m too glad you don&rsquo;t
disappoint me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t leave her&mdash;no.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s she who has left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left him to us?&rdquo; Gravener asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
monster&mdash;many thanks!&nbsp; I decline to take
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear more about him in spite of
yourself.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t, no, I really can&rsquo;t resist
the impression that he&rsquo;s a big man.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
already mastering&mdash;to my shame perhaps be it said&mdash;just
the tone my old friend least liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s doubtless only a trifle,&rdquo; he returned,
&ldquo;but you haven&rsquo;t happened to mention what his
reputation&rsquo;s to rest on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on what I began by boring you with&mdash;his
extraordinary mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As exhibited in his writings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk,
which is far and away the richest I ever listened to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, don&rsquo;t ask me!&nbsp; About
everything!&rdquo; I pursued, reminding myself of poor
Adelaide.&nbsp; &ldquo;About his ideas of things,&rdquo; I then
more charitably added.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have heard him to
know what I mean&mdash;it&rsquo;s unlike anything that ever was
heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; I coloured, I admit, I overcharged a little,
for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram&rsquo;s later
development and still more of my fuller acquaintance with
him.&nbsp; However, I really expressed, a little lyrically
perhaps, my actual imagination of him when I proceeded to declare
that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend, he might very well go
down to posterity as the greatest of all great talkers.&nbsp;
Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row
should be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be
pampered and pensioned.&nbsp; The greater the wind-bag the
greater the calamity.&nbsp; Out of proportion to everything else
on earth had come to be this wagging of the tongue.&nbsp; We were
drenched with talk&mdash;our wretched age was dying of it.&nbsp;
I differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to
concede, and gladly, that we were drenched with sound.&nbsp; It
was not however the mere speakers who were killing us&mdash;it
was the mere stammerers.&nbsp; Fine talk was as rare as it was
refreshing&mdash;the gift of the gods themselves, the one starry
spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.&nbsp; How many men were
there who rose to this privilege, of how many masters of
conversation could he boast the acquaintance?&nbsp; Dying of
talk?&mdash;why we were dying of the lack of it!&nbsp; Bad
writing wasn&rsquo;t talk, as many people seemed to think, and
even good wasn&rsquo;t always to be compared to it.&nbsp; From
the best talk indeed the best writing had something to
learn.&nbsp; I fancifully added that we too should peradventure
be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for having
listened, for having actually heard.&nbsp; Gravener, who had
glanced at his watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all
this a retort beautifully characteristic of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one little fact to be borne in mind in
the presence equally of the best talk and of the
worst.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked, in saying this, as if he meant
great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that
neither of them mattered if a man wasn&rsquo;t a real
gentleman.&nbsp; Perhaps it was what he did mean; he deprived me
however of the exultation of being right by putting the truth in
a slightly different way.&nbsp; &ldquo;The only thing that really
counts for one&rsquo;s estimate of a person is his
conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had his watch still in his palm, and I
reproached him with unfair play in having ascertained beforehand
that it was now the hour at which I always gave in.&nbsp; My
pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly added
that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no
exception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me then to try to be good at any price!&rdquo; I
laughed as I went with him to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare I
will be, if I have to be horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> that first night was one of the
liveliest, or at any rate was the freshest, of my exaltations,
there was another, four years later, that was one of my great
discomposures.&nbsp; Repetition, I well knew by this time, was
the secret of Saltram&rsquo;s power to alienate, and of course
one would never have seen him at his finest if one hadn&rsquo;t
seen him in his remorses.&nbsp; They set in mainly at this season
and were magnificent, elemental, orchestral.&nbsp; I was quite
aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances was now due; but
none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his feet as a
lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were a
large order, as we said, for a short course of five.&nbsp; This
was the second time, and it was past nine o&rsquo;clock; the
audience, a muster unprecedented and really encouraging, had
fortunately the attitude of blandness that might have been looked
for in persons whom the promise of (if I&rsquo;m not mistaken) An
Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the neighbourhood of Upper
Baker Street.&nbsp; There was in those days in that region a
petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the
funds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the
maintenance of five small Saltrams&mdash;I include the
mother&mdash;and one large one.&nbsp; By the time the Saltrams,
of different sizes, were all maintained we had pretty well poured
out the oil that might have lubricated the machinery for enabling
the most original of men to appear to maintain them.</p>
<p>It was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach,
standing up there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half
a dozen thin benches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of
anything so cynical as a suspicion, that we couldn&rsquo;t so
much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.&nbsp; There was nothing to
plead but that our scouts had been out from the early hours and
that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad&mdash;he took
one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a
company&mdash;some accident had disabled or delayed him.&nbsp;
The meditative walks were a fiction, for he never, that any one
could discover, prepared anything but a magnificent prospectus;
hence his circulars and programmes, of which I possess an almost
complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of generations never
born.&nbsp; I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best; but
I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my
want of public optimism.&nbsp; This time therefore I left the
excuses to his more practised patience, only relieving myself in
response to a direct appeal from a young lady next whom, in the
hall, I found myself sitting.&nbsp; My position was an accident,
but if it had been calculated the reason would scarce have eluded
an observer of the fact that no one else in the room had an
approach to an appearance.&nbsp; Our philosopher&rsquo;s
&ldquo;tail&rdquo; was deplorably limp.&nbsp; This visitor was
the only person who looked at her ease, who had come a little in
the spirit of adventure.&nbsp; She seemed to carry amusement in
her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a little
mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram&rsquo;s sphere of
influence.&nbsp; He was doing better than we hoped, and he had
chosen such an occasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven
knew which of his fond infirmities.&nbsp; The young lady produced
an impression of auburn hair and black velvet, and had on her
other hand a companion of obscurer type, presumably a
waiting-maid.&nbsp; She herself might perhaps have been a foreign
countess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry
interval by finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some
novel of Madame Sand.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t make her more
fathomable to pass in a few minutes from this to the certitude
that she was American; it simply engendered depressing reflexions
as to the possible check to contributions from Boston.&nbsp; She
asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would
recommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered
I was on my honour I would privately deprecate it.&nbsp; Perhaps
she didn&rsquo;t; at any rate our talk took a turn that prolonged
it till she became aware we were left almost alone.&nbsp; I
presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and this explained
in a manner the miracle.&nbsp; The brotherhood of the friends of
the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I
should say the sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.&nbsp; Like
the Kent Mulvilles I belonged to both fraternities, and even
better than they I think I had sounded the abyss of Mrs.
Saltram&rsquo;s wrongs.&nbsp; She bored me to extinction, and I
knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were
those who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed
the handful of poor Saltram&rsquo;s backers.&nbsp; They did her
liberal justice, whereas her mere patrons and partisans had
nothing but hatred for our philosopher.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m bound to
say it was we, however&mdash;we of both camps, as it
were&mdash;who had always done most for her.</p>
<p>I thought my young lady looked rich&mdash;I scarcely knew why;
and I hoped she had put her hand in her pocket.&nbsp; I soon made
her out, however, not at all a fine fanatic&mdash;she was but a
generous, irresponsible enquirer.&nbsp; She had come to England
to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt&rsquo;s she had met the
dreary lady we had all so much on our mind.&nbsp; I saw
she&rsquo;d help to pass the time when she observed that it was a
pity this lady wasn&rsquo;t intrinsically more interesting.&nbsp;
That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in Mrs.
Saltram&rsquo;s circle&mdash;at least among those who scorned to
know her horrid husband&mdash;that she was attractive on her
merits.&nbsp; She was in truth a most ordinary person, as Saltram
himself would have been if he hadn&rsquo;t been a prodigy.&nbsp;
The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was a
measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.&nbsp; I hasten to
add that the consequences of your doing so were no sufficient
reason for his having left her to starve.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much force of character,&rdquo; said
my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my departing
friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were
making a joke of their discomfiture.&nbsp; My joke probably cost
Saltram a subscription or two, but it helped me on with my
interlocutress.&nbsp; &ldquo;She says he drinks like a
fish,&rdquo; she sociably continued, &ldquo;and yet she allows
that his mind&rsquo;s wonderfully clear.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
amusing to converse with a pretty girl who could talk of the
clearness of Saltram&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; I expected next to hear
she had been assured he was awfully clever.&nbsp; I tried to tell
her&mdash;I had it almost on my conscience&mdash;what was the
proper way to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than
ever on this occasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I
wasn&rsquo;t after all very sure of it.&nbsp; She had come
to-night out of high curiosity&mdash;she had wanted to learn this
proper way for herself.&nbsp; She had read some of his papers and
hadn&rsquo;t understood them; but it was at home, at her
aunt&rsquo;s, that her curiosity had been kindled&mdash;kindled
mainly by his wife&rsquo;s remarkable stories of his want of
virtue.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose they ought to have kept me
away,&rdquo; my companion dropped, &ldquo;and I suppose
they&rsquo;d have done so if I hadn&rsquo;t somehow got an idea
that he&rsquo;s fascinating.&nbsp; In fact Mrs. Saltram herself
says he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you came to see where the fascination resides?&nbsp;
Well, you&rsquo;ve seen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My young lady raised fine eyebrows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean
in his bad faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession,
that is, of some quality or other that condemns us in advance to
forgive him the humiliation, as I may call it, to which he has
subjected us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The humiliation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors,
before you as the purchaser of a ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let her charming gay eyes rest on me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t look humiliated a bit, and if you did I should let
you off, disappointed as I am; for the mysterious quality you
speak of is just the quality I came to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t &lsquo;see&rsquo; it!&rdquo; I
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How then do you get at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t suppose
he&rsquo;s good-looking,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why his wife says he&rsquo;s lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it
broke out afresh.&nbsp; Had she acted only in obedience to this
singular plea, so characteristic, on Mrs. Saltram&rsquo;s part,
of what was irritating in the narrowness of that lady&rsquo;s
point of view?&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Saltram,&rdquo; I explained,
&ldquo;undervalues him where he&rsquo;s strongest, so that, to
make up for it perhaps, she overpraises him where he&rsquo;s
weak.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not, assuredly, superficially attractive;
he&rsquo;s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his great
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his great eyes,&rdquo; said my young lady
attentively.&nbsp; She had evidently heard all about his great
eyes&mdash;the beaux yeux for which alone we had really done it
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tragic and splendid&mdash;lights on a
dangerous coast.&nbsp; But he moves badly and dresses worse, and
altogether he&rsquo;s anything but smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment
appealed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you call him a real
gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of
recognising it: George Gravener, years before, that first flushed
night, had put me face to face with it.&nbsp; It had embarrassed
me then, but it didn&rsquo;t embarrass me now, for I had lived
with it and overcome it and disposed of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A real
gentleman?&nbsp; Emphatically not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how
little it was to Gravener I was now talking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
say that because he&rsquo;s&mdash;what do you call it in
England?&mdash;of humble extraction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&nbsp; His father was a country school-master
and his mother the widow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do
with it.&nbsp; I say it simply because I know him
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it an awful drawback?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful&mdash;quite awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean isn&rsquo;t it positively fatal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fatal to what?&nbsp; Not to his magnificent
vitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she had a meditative moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is his
magnificent vitality the cause of his vices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your questions are formidable, but I&rsquo;m glad you
put them.&nbsp; I was thinking of his noble intellect.&nbsp; His
vices, as you say, have been much exaggerated: they consist
mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A want of will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A want of dignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t recognise his obligations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion,
especially in public: he smiles and bows and beckons across the
street to them.&nbsp; But when they pass over he turns away, and
he speedily loses them in the crowd.&nbsp; The
recognition&rsquo;s purely spiritual&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t in the
least social.&nbsp; So he leaves all his belongings to other
people to take care of.&nbsp; He accepts favours, loans,
sacrifices&mdash;all with nothing more deterrent than an agony of
shame.&nbsp; Fortunately we&rsquo;re a little faithful band, and
we do what we can.&rdquo;&nbsp; I held my tongue about the
natural children, engendered, to the number of three, in the
wantonness of his youth.&nbsp; I only remarked that he did make
efforts&mdash;often tremendous ones.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the
efforts,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;never come to much: the only
things that come to much are the abandonments, the
surrenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much do they come to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right to put it as if we had a big bill to
pay, but, as I&rsquo;ve told you before, your questions are
rather terrible.&nbsp; They come, these mere exercises of genius,
to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a mighty mass of
speculation, notation, quotation.&nbsp; The genius is there, you
see, to meet the surrender; but there&rsquo;s no genius to
support the defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is there, after all, at his age, to
show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the way of achievement recognised and reputation
established?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;To &lsquo;show&rsquo;
if you will, there isn&rsquo;t much, since his writing, mostly,
isn&rsquo;t as fine, isn&rsquo;t certainly as showy, as his
talk.&nbsp; Moreover two-thirds of his work are merely colossal
projects and announcements.&nbsp; &lsquo;Showing&rsquo; Frank
Saltram is often a poor business,&rdquo; I went on: &ldquo;we
endeavoured, you&rsquo;ll have observed, to show him
to-night!&nbsp; However, if he had lectured he&rsquo;d have
lectured divinely.&nbsp; It would just have been his
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would his talk just have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of
a little impatience, as I replied: &ldquo;The exhibition of a
splendid intellect.&rdquo;&nbsp; My young lady looked not quite
satisfied at this, but as I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for another
question I hastily pursued: &ldquo;The sight of a great suspended
swinging crystal&mdash;huge lucid lustrous, a block of
light&mdash;flashing back every impression of life and every
possibility of thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to
the dusky porch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a
quiet brougham were almost the only thing Saltram&rsquo;s
treachery hadn&rsquo;t extinguished.&nbsp; I went with her to the
door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment after she
had thanked me and taken her seat.&nbsp; Her smile even in the
darkness was pretty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do want to see that
crystal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only to come to the next
lecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait over till next week,&rdquo; I suggested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She became grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not unless he really
comes!&rdquo;&nbsp; At which the brougham started off, carrying
her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to allow me to
exclaim &ldquo;Ingratitude!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Saltram</span> made a great affair of
her right to be informed where her husband had been the second
evening he failed to meet his audience.&nbsp; She came to me to
ascertain, but I couldn&rsquo;t satisfy her, for in spite of my
ingenuity I remained in ignorance.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t till
much later that I found this had not been the case with Kent
Mulville, whose hope for the best never twirled the thumbs of him
more placidly than when he happened to know the worst.&nbsp; He
had known it on the occasion I speak of&mdash;that is immediately
after.&nbsp; He was impenetrable then, but ultimately
confessed.&nbsp; What he confessed was more than I shall now
venture to make public.&nbsp; It was of course familiar to me
that Saltram was incapable of keeping the engagements which,
after their separation, he had entered into with regard to his
wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite irreproachable
and insufferable person.&nbsp; She often appeared at my chambers
to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed
her hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this
ablution, which she handed about for analysis.&nbsp; She had arts
of her own of exciting one&rsquo;s impatience, the most
infallible of which was perhaps her assumption that we were kind
to her because we liked her.&nbsp; In reality her personal fall
had been a sort of social rise&mdash;since I had seen the moment
when, in our little conscientious circle, her desolation almost
made her the fashion.&nbsp; Her voice was grating and her
children ugly; moreover she hated the good Mulvilles, whom I more
and more loved.&nbsp; They were the people who by doing most for
her husband had in the long run done most for herself; and the
warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a
pressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m bound to say he didn&rsquo;t criticise his benefactors,
though practically he got tired of them; she, however, had the
highest standards about eleemosynary forms.&nbsp; She offered the
odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by dependence, and indeed it
had introduced her to some excellent society.&nbsp; She pitied me
for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she
doubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing
me.&nbsp; I dare say I should have got on with her better if she
had had a ray of imagination&mdash;if it had occasionally seemed
to occur to her to regard Saltram&rsquo;s expressions of his
nature in any other manner than as separate subjects of
woe.&nbsp; They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung
on an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of
challenging them one after the other, as if she never suspected
that he had a character, such as it was, or that deficiencies
might be organic; the irritating effect of a mind incapable of a
generalisation.&nbsp; One might doubtless have overdone the idea
that there was a general licence for such a man; but if this had
happened it would have been through one&rsquo;s feeling that
there could be none for such a woman.</p>
<p>I recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt
of the disappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from
an English-French or other phrase-book.&nbsp; She triumphed in
what she told me and she may have triumphed still more in what
she withheld.&nbsp; My friend of the other evening, Miss Anvoy,
had but lately come to England; Lady Coxon, the aunt, had been
established here for years in consequence of her marriage with
the late Sir Gregory of that name.&nbsp; She had a house in the
Regent&rsquo;s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all
she had sympathy.&nbsp; Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance
through mutual friends.&nbsp; This vagueness caused me to feel
how much I was out of it and how large an independent circle Mrs.
Saltram had at her command.&nbsp; I should have been glad to know
more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I should know
most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have
mysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.&nbsp; For the
present, moreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having
in fact gone abroad accompanied by her niece.&nbsp; The niece,
besides being immensely clever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram
said; the only daughter and the light of the eyes of some great
American merchant, a man, over there, of endless indulgences and
dollars.&nbsp; She had pretty clothes and pretty manners, and she
had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.&nbsp; The
great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she
spoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn&rsquo;t
know where to turn for it.&nbsp; A few months later indeed, when
they had come back, her tone perceptibly changed: she alluded to
them, on my leading her up to it, rather as to persons in her
debt for favours received.&nbsp; What had happened I didn&rsquo;t
know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a little less
to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social
countenance&mdash;people for whom she had vainly tried to do
something.&nbsp; I confess I saw how it wouldn&rsquo;t be in a
mere week or two that I should rid myself of the image of Ruth
Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it, I found something
secretly to like.&nbsp; I should probably neither see her nor
hear of her again: the knight&rsquo;s widow (he had been mayor of
Clockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her
inheritance.&nbsp; I gathered with surprise that she had not
communicated to his wife the story of her attempt to hear
Mr..Saltram, and I founded this reticence on the easy supposition
that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by overpressure the spring of the
sympathy of which she boasted.&nbsp; The girl at any rate would
forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a husband;
besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her
experiment.</p>
<p>We clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered
without an accident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the
paying public aware of our great man, but the fact remained that
in the case of an inspiration so unequal there was treachery,
there was fallacy at least, in the very conception of a
series.&nbsp; In our scrutiny of ways and means we were
inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the
syllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand
free hand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at
our playbills even while I stickled for them.&nbsp; It was indeed
amusing work to be scrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at
moments laughed about it, so far as the comfort of a sigh so
unstudied as to be cheerful might pass for such a sound.&nbsp; He
admitted with a candour all his own that he was in truth only to
be depended on in the Mulvilles&rsquo; drawing-room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he suggestively allowed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
there, I think, that I&rsquo;m at my best; quite late, when it
gets toward eleven&mdash;and if I&rsquo;ve not been too much
worried.&rdquo;&nbsp; We all knew what too much worry meant; it
meant too enslaved for the hour to the superstition of
sobriety.&nbsp; On the Saturdays I used to bring my portmanteau,
so as not to have to think of eleven o&rsquo;clock trains.&nbsp;
I had a bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its
altars of cushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its
large fireside and clear lamplight, we might really arrive at
something if the Mulvilles would but charge for admission.&nbsp;
Here it was, however, that they shamelessly broke down; as
there&rsquo;s a flaw in every perfection this was the
inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.&nbsp; They declined to make
their saloon a market, so that Saltram&rsquo;s golden words
continued the sole coin that rang there.&nbsp; It can have
happened to no man, however, to be paid a greater price than such
an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his greatest nights.&nbsp;
The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence; all minor
eloquence grew dumb.&nbsp; Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of
her hospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked
the fire.&nbsp; I used to call it the music-room, for we had
anticipated Bayreuth.&nbsp; The very gates of the kingdom of
light seemed to open and the horizon of thought to flash with the
beauty of a sunrise at sea.</p>
<p>In the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our
little board, we were always conscious of the creak of Mrs.
Saltram&rsquo;s shoes.&nbsp; She hovered, she interrupted, she
almost presided, the state of affairs being mostly such as to
supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was to be done
next.&nbsp; It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that,
in concatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather,
led her so often to my door.&nbsp; She thought us spiritless
creatures with editors and publishers; but she carried matters to
no great effect when she personally pushed into back-shops.&nbsp;
She wanted all moneys to be paid to herself: they were otherwise
liable to such strange adventures.&nbsp; They trickled away into
the desert&mdash;they were mainly at best, alas, a slender
stream.&nbsp; The editors and the publishers were the last people
to take this remarkable thinker at the valuation that has now
pretty well come to be established.&nbsp; The former were
half-distraught between the desire to &ldquo;cut&rdquo; him and
the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a
volume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the
latter they suggested alternative titles which, as reported to
our friend, brought into his face the noble blank melancholy that
sometimes made it handsome.&nbsp; The title of an unwritten book
didn&rsquo;t after all much matter, but some masterpiece of
Saltram&rsquo;s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with
which it was then convulsed.&nbsp; The ideal solution, failing
the fee at Kent Mulville&rsquo;s door, would have been some
system of subscription to projected treatises with their
non-appearance provided for&mdash;provided for, I mean, by the
indulgence of subscribers.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s real
misfortune was that subscribers were so wretchedly literal.&nbsp;
When they tastelessly enquired why publication hadn&rsquo;t
ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had ever been so
published.&nbsp; Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous
form, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the
work.</p>
<h2><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>V</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> doubtless often a nuisance to
my friends in those years; but there were sacrifices I declined
to make, and I never passed the hat to George Gravener.&nbsp; I
never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I think
it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had
found so easy to Mss Anvoy.&nbsp; It had cost me nothing to
confide to this charming girl, but it would have cost me much to
confide to the friend of my youth, that the character of the
&ldquo;real gentleman&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t an attribute of the man
I took such pains for.&nbsp; Was this because I had already
generalised to the point of perceiving that women are really the
unfastidious sex?&nbsp; I knew at any rate that Gravener, already
quite in view but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough
more ambition than charity.&nbsp; He had sharp aims for stray
sovereigns, being in view most from the tall steeple of
Clockborough.&nbsp; His immediate ambition was to occupy &agrave;
lui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all
his movements and postures were calculated for the favouring
angle.&nbsp; The movement of the hand as to the pocket had thus
to alternate gracefully with the posture of the hand on the
heart.&nbsp; He talked to Clockborough in short only less
beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors; with the
difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and
that our candidate had no antagonist but himself.&nbsp; He had
more than once been at Wimbledon&mdash;it was Mrs.
Mulville&rsquo;s work not mine&mdash;and by the time the claret
was served had seen the god descend.&nbsp; He took more pains to
swing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town
he forestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as
to express by the observation that such a man was&mdash;a hundred
times!&mdash;a man to use and never a man to be used by.&nbsp; I
remember that this neat remark humiliated me almost as much as if
virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I hadn&rsquo;t often
made it myself.&nbsp; The difference was that on Gravener&rsquo;s
part a force attached to it that could never attach to it on
mine.&nbsp; He was able to use people&mdash;he had the machinery;
and the irony of Saltram&rsquo;s being made showy at Clockborough
came out to me when he said, as if he had no memory of our
original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: &ldquo;I hate
his type, you know, but I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I don&rsquo;t put
some of those things in.&nbsp; I can find a place for them: we
might even find a place for the fellow himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
myself should have had some fear&mdash;not, I need scarcely say,
for the &ldquo;things&rdquo; themselves, but for some other
things very near them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.</p>
<p>Later on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in
this case so appropriate as he would have been had the polities
of the gods only coincided more exactly with those of the
party.&nbsp; There was a distinct moment when, without saying
anything more definite to me, Gravener entertained the idea of
annexing Mr. Saltram.&nbsp; Such a project was delusive, for the
discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and that
pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough&mdash;the bottling,
in a word, of the air of those lungs for convenient public
uncorking in corn-exchanges&mdash;was an experiment for which no
one had the leisure.&nbsp; The only thing would have been to
carry him massively about, paid, caged, clipped; to turn him on
for a particular occasion in a particular channel.&nbsp; Frank
Saltram&rsquo;s channel, however, was essentially not calculable,
and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have
ensued.&nbsp; For what there would have been to do The Empire,
the great newspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new
misfortune that there were delicate situations in which The
Empire broke down.&nbsp; In fine there was an instinctive
apprehension that a clever young journalist commissioned to
report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the
errand.&nbsp; No one knew better than George Gravener that that
was a time when prompt returns counted double.&nbsp; If he
therefore found our friend an exasperating waste of orthodoxy it
was because of his being, as he said, poor Gravener, up in the
clouds, not because he was down in the dust.&nbsp; The man would
have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he could
have helped to put in a real gentleman.&nbsp; Gravener&rsquo;s
great objection to the actual member was that he was not one.</p>
<p>Lady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with
&ldquo;grounds,&rdquo; at Clockborough, which she had let; but
after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs. Saltram that
the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume
possession.&nbsp; I could see the faded red livery, the big
square shoulders, the high-walled garden of this decent
abode.&nbsp; As the rumble of dissolution grew louder the suitor
would have pressed his suit, and I found myself hoping the
politics of the late Mayor&rsquo;s widow wouldn&rsquo;t be such
as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so
far as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any
contact.&nbsp; I tried to focus the many-buttoned page, in the
daily airing, as he perhaps even pushed the Bath-chair over
somebody&rsquo;s toes.&nbsp; I was destined to hear, none the
less, through Mrs. Saltram&mdash;who, I afterwards learned, was
in correspondence with Lady Coxon&rsquo;s housekeeper&mdash;that
Gravener was known to have spoken of the habitation I had in my
eye as the pleasantest thing at Clockborough.&nbsp; On his part,
I was sure, this was the voice not of envy but of
experience.&nbsp; The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could
see him in the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be
certain, and very justly, to think him good-looking.&nbsp; It
would be too much to describe myself as troubled by this play of
surmise; but I occur to remember the relief, singular enough, of
feeling it suddenly brushed away by an annoyance really much
greater; an annoyance the result of its happening to come over me
about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of Frank
Saltram.&nbsp; There were limits after all, and my mark at last
had been reached.</p>
<p>I had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an
expression; but this was a supreme revolt.&nbsp; Certain things
cleared up in my mind, certain values stood out.&nbsp; It was all
very well to have an unfortunate temperament; there was nothing
so unfortunate as to have, for practical purposes, nothing
else.&nbsp; I avoided George Gravener at this moment and
reflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by
leaving England.&nbsp; I wanted to forget Frank
Saltram&mdash;that was all.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to do
anything in the world to him but that.&nbsp; Indignation had
withered on the stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much
as one ought only by never thinking of him again.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t for anything he had done to me; it was for what he
had done to the Mulvilles.&nbsp; Adelaide cried about it for a
week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally given
him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,
the drop too much, unanswered.&nbsp; The letter, an incredible
one, addressed by Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the
Pudneys at Ramsgate, was the central feature of the incident,
which, however, had many features, each more painful than
whichever other we compared it with.&nbsp; The Pudneys had
behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.&nbsp; Base
ingratitude, gross indecency&mdash;one had one&rsquo;s choice
only of such formulas as that the more they fitted the less they
gave one rest.&nbsp; These are dead aches now, and I am under no
obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the
business.&nbsp; There are things which if I had had to tell
them&mdash;well, would have stopped me off here altogether.</p>
<p>I went abroad for the general election, and if I don&rsquo;t
know how much, on the Continent, I forgot, I at least know how
much I missed, him.&nbsp; At a distance, in a foreign land,
ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I discovered what he had done
for me.&nbsp; I owed him, oh unmistakeably, certain noble
conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky lamp, and
lo it continued to twinkle.&nbsp; But the light it gave me just
showed me how much more I wanted.&nbsp; I was pursued of course
by letters from Mrs. Saltram which I didn&rsquo;t scruple not to
read, though quite aware her embarrassments couldn&rsquo;t but be
now of the gravest.&nbsp; I sacrificed to propriety by simply
putting them away, and this is how, one day as my absence drew to
an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another paper,
was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the
packet.&nbsp; The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared,
was engaged to be married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news
was two months old.&nbsp; A direct question of Mrs.
Saltram&rsquo;s had thus remained unanswered&mdash;she had
enquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to
such a hand might be.&nbsp; The great other fact about him just
then was that he had been triumphantly returned for Clockborough
in the interest of the party that had swept the country&mdash;so
that I might easily have referred Mrs. Saltram to the journals of
the day.&nbsp; Yet when I at last wrote her that I was coming
home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her, I
but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put
it to Miss Anvoy.</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> almost avoided the general
election, but some of its consequences, on my return, had smartly
to be faced.&nbsp; The season, in London, began to breathe again
and to flap its folded wings.&nbsp; Confidence, under the new
Ministry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms,
in a social body, was a recovery of appetite.&nbsp; People once
more fed together, and it happened that, one Saturday night, at
somebody&rsquo;s house, I fed with George Gravener.&nbsp; When
the ladies left the room I moved up to where he sat and begged to
congratulate him.&nbsp; &ldquo;On my election?&rdquo; he asked
after a moment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have
heard of that triumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a
victory still more personal.&nbsp; I dare say I coloured however,
for his political success had momentarily passed out of my
mind.&nbsp; What was present to it was that he was to marry that
beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious of some
discomposure&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t intended to put this before
everything.&nbsp; He himself indeed ought gracefully to have done
so, and I remember thinking the whole man was in this assumption
that in expressing my sense of what he had won I had fixed my
thoughts on his &ldquo;seat.&rdquo;&nbsp; We straightened the
matter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately
seen him that his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold
source.&nbsp; He was so good as to say that he hoped I should
soon make the acquaintance of Miss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was
presently coming up to town.&nbsp; Lady Coxon, in the country,
had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed their
arrival.&nbsp; I told him I had heard the marriage would be a
splendid one; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he
laughed and said &ldquo;Do you mean for her?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I
had again explained what I meant he went on: &ldquo;Oh
she&rsquo;s an American, but you&rsquo;d scarcely know it;
unless, perhaps,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;by her being used to
more money than most girls in England, even the daughters of rich
men.&nbsp; That wouldn&rsquo;t in the least do for a fellow like
me, you know, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the great liberality of her
father.&nbsp; He really has been most kind, and
everything&rsquo;s quite satisfactory.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added that
his eldest brother had taken a tremendous fancy to her and that
during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly won over Lady
Maddock.&nbsp; I gathered from something he dropped later on that
the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a
settlement, but had given a handsome present and was apparently
to be looked to, across the water, for other favours.&nbsp;
People are simplified alike by great contentments and great
yearnings, and, whether or no it was Gravener&rsquo;s directness
that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some turn taken by
our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to ask
if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her
aunt.&nbsp; My enquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the
oddest of women, would have in any contingency to act under her
late husband&rsquo;s will, which was odder still, saddling her
with a mass of queer obligations complicated with queer
loopholes.&nbsp; There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins,
old maids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.&nbsp;
Gravener laughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the
young lady might come in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if
he suspected my turning a lantern on him, he declared quite
dryly: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all rot&mdash;one&rsquo;s moved by
other springs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fortnight later, at Lady Coxon&rsquo;s own house, I
understood well enough the springs one was moved by.&nbsp;
Gravener had spoken of me there as an old friend, and I received
a gracious invitation to dine.&nbsp; The Knight&rsquo;s widow was
again indisposed&mdash;she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so
that I found Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even
Gravener&rsquo;s help, since, to make matters worse, he had just
sent up word that the House, the insatiable House, with which he
supposed he had contracted for easier terms, positively declined
to release him.&nbsp; I was struck with the courage, the grace
and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the fauna and
flora of the Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; I did what I could to
help her to classify them, after I had recovered from the
confusion of seeing her slightly disconcerted at perceiving in
the guest introduced by her intended the gentleman with whom she
had had that talk about Frank Saltram.&nbsp; I had at this moment
my first glimpse of the fact that she was a person who could
carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to judge of my
sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,
when I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.&nbsp; From what
immediately passed between the two ladies I gathered that the
latter had been sent for post-haste to fill the gap created by
the absence of the mistress of the house.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I remember crying, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be put
by me;&rdquo; and my apprehension was promptly justified.&nbsp;
Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner, and taken in as a consequence of
an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs. Saltram with a
vengeance.&nbsp; I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing
such things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener
was verily fortunate.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t happened to tell him
of her visit to Upper Baker Street, but she&rsquo;d certainly
tell him to-morrow; not indeed that this would make him like any
better her having had the innocence to invite such a person as
Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.&nbsp; It could only strike me
that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her
cleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was
when, after dinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant
mirth: &ldquo;Oh you don&rsquo;t admire Mrs.
Saltram?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; This was truly a young
person without guile.&nbsp; I had briefly to consider before I
could reply that my objection to the lady named was the objection
often uttered about people met at the social board&mdash;I knew
all her stories.&nbsp; Then as Miss Anvoy remained momentarily
vague I added: &ldquo;Those about her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, but there are some new ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None for me.&nbsp; Ah novelty would be
pleasant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it appear that of late he has been
particularly horrid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His fluctuations don&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;, I returned,
&ldquo;for at night all cats are grey.&nbsp; You saw the shade of
this one the night we waited for him together.&nbsp; What will
you have?&nbsp; He has no dignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American
distinctness, looked encouragingly round at some of the
combinations she had risked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad I
can&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Gravener won&rsquo;t let you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked him.&nbsp; He lets me do
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us
see in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t happened to talk of him,&rdquo; the
girl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him to take you some day out to see the
Mulvilles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utterly.&nbsp; But that won&rsquo;t prevent his being
planted there again, to bloom like a rose, within a month or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Anvoy thought a moment.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;I should like
to see them,&rdquo; she said with her fostering smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tremendously worth it.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t miss them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make George take me,&rdquo; she went on as
Mrs. Saltram came up to interrupt us.&nbsp; She sniffed at this
unfortunate as kindly as she had smiled at me and, addressing the
question to her, continued: &ldquo;But the chance of a
lecture&mdash;one of the wonderful lectures?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
there another course announced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&nbsp; There are about thirty!&rdquo; I
exclaimed, turning away and feeling Mrs. Saltram&rsquo;s little
eyes in my back.&nbsp; A few days after this I heard that
Gravener&rsquo;s marriage was near at hand&mdash;was settled for
Whitsuntide; but as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts,
and there presently came to me in fact the report of a
postponement.&nbsp; Something was the matter; what was the matter
was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now critically ill.&nbsp;
I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent&rsquo;s Park,
but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.&nbsp; I forget
to-day the exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents
occurred and the particular stage at which it suddenly struck me,
making me catch my breath a little, that the progression, the
acceleration, was for all the world that of fine drama.&nbsp;
This was probably rather late in the day, and the exact order
doesn&rsquo;t signify.&nbsp; What had already occurred was some
accident determining a more patient wait.&nbsp; George Gravener,
whom I met again, in fact told me as much, but without signs of
perturbation.&nbsp; Lady Coxon had to be constantly attended to,
and there were other good reasons as well.&nbsp; Lady Coxon had
to be so constantly attended to that on the occasion of a second
attempt in the Regent&rsquo;s Park I equally failed to obtain a
sight of her niece.&nbsp; I judged it discreet in all the
conditions not to make a third; but this didn&rsquo;t matter, for
it was through Adelaide Mulville that the side-wind of the
comedy, though I was at first unwitting, began to reach me.&nbsp;
I went to Wimbledon at times because Saltram was there, and I
went at others because he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The Pudneys, who
had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we
had a horrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in
dishonour, about the smoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear
wandered on the storm-lashed heath.&nbsp; His room, upstairs, had
been lately done up (I could hear the crackle of the new chintz)
and the difference only made his smirches and bruises, his
splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.&nbsp; If he
wasn&rsquo;t barefoot in the mire he was sure to be
unconventionally shod.&nbsp; These were the things Adelaide and
I, who were old enough friends to stare at each other in silence,
talked about when we didn&rsquo;t speak.&nbsp; When we spoke it
was only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry
and whom he had brought out the other Sunday.&nbsp; I could see
that this presentation had been happy, for Mrs. Mulville
commemorated it after her sole fashion of showing confidence in a
new relation.&nbsp; &ldquo;She likes me&mdash;she likes
me&rdquo;: her native humility exulted in that measure of
success.&nbsp; We all knew for ourselves how she liked those who
liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy she was more easily won over
than Lady Maddock.</p>
<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the consequences, for the
Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made for Frank Saltram was that
they had to give up their carriage.&nbsp; Adelaide drove gently
into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early Victorian
landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down
jobmaster whose wife was in consumption&mdash;a vehicle that made
people turn round all the more when her pensioner sat beside her
in a soft white hat and a shawl, one of the dear woman&rsquo;s
own.&nbsp; This was his position and I dare say his costume when
on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s
visit.&nbsp; The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid
silences deep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike
unutterable, Saltram was reinstated.&nbsp; Was it in pride or in
penance that Mrs. Mulville had begun immediately to drive him
about?&nbsp; If he was ashamed of his ingratitude she might have
been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was incorrigibly capable
of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while she was in
shops or with her acquaintance.&nbsp; However, if he was in the
pillory for twenty minutes in the Regent&rsquo;s Park&mdash;I
mean at Lady Coxon&rsquo;s door while his companion paid her
call&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t to the further humiliation of any one
concerned that she presently came out for him in person, not even
to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew him in
to be introduced to the bright young American.&nbsp; Her account
of the introduction I had in its order, but before that, very
late in the season, under Gravener&rsquo;s auspices, I met Miss
Anvoy at tea at the House of Commons.&nbsp; The member for
Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty ladies, and the
Mulvilles were not of the party.&nbsp; On the great terrace, as I
strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately
exclaimed to me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him, you
know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen him!&rdquo;&nbsp; She told me about
Saltram&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh so strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell till I see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener
was looking at us.&nbsp; She turned back toward the knot of the
others, and I said: &ldquo;Dislike him as much as you
will&mdash;I see you&rsquo;re bitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitten?&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought she coloured a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; I laughed;
&ldquo;one doesn&rsquo;t die of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shan&rsquo;t die of anything before I&rsquo;ve
seen more of Mrs. Mulville.&rdquo;&nbsp; I rejoiced with her over
plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the loveliest woman she had
met in England; but before we separated I remarked to her that it
was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if she should see
more of Frank Saltram&mdash;which would be likely to follow on
any increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville&mdash;she might
find herself flattening her nose against the clear hard pane of
an eternal question&mdash;that of the relative, that of the
opposed, importances of virtue and brains.&nbsp; She replied that
this was surely a subject on which one took everything for
granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed myself
ill.&nbsp; What I referred to was what I had referred to the
night we met in Upper Baker Street&mdash;the relative importance
(relative to virtue) of other gifts.&nbsp; She asked me if I
called virtue a gift&mdash;a thing handed to us in a parcel on
our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry proved
to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.&nbsp; She
would have help however, the same help I myself had once had, in
resisting its tendency to make one cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What help do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of the member for Clockborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared, smiled, then returned: &ldquo;Why my idea has been
to help him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had helped him&mdash;I had his own word for it that at
Clockborough her bedevilment of the voters had really put him
in.&nbsp; She would do so doubtless again and again, though I
heard the very next month that this fine faculty had undergone a
temporary eclipse.&nbsp; News of the catastrophe first came to me
from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at Wimbledon:
poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble&mdash;great disasters in America
had suddenly summoned her home.&nbsp; Her father, in New York,
had suffered reverses, lost so much money that it was really
vexatious as showing how much he had had.&nbsp; It was Adelaide
who told me she had gone off alone at less than a week&rsquo;s
notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&nbsp; Gravener has permitted that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you have?&nbsp; The House of
Commons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much
interested.&nbsp; Of course he&rsquo;d follow her as soon as he
was free to make her his wife; only she mightn&rsquo;t now be
able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion of which he
had begun by having the virtual promise.&nbsp; Mrs. Mulville let
me know what was already said: she was charming, this American
girl, but really these American fathers&mdash;!&nbsp; What was a
man to do?&nbsp; Mr. Saltram, according to Mrs. Mulville, was of
opinion that a man was never to suffer his relation to money to
become a spiritual relation&mdash;he was to keep it exclusively
material.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moi pas comprendre!&rdquo; I commented on
this; in rejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful
sympathy, explained that she supposed he simply meant that the
thing was to use it, don&rsquo;t you know? but not to think too
much about it.&nbsp; &ldquo;To take it, but not to thank you for
it?&rdquo; I still more profanely enquired.&nbsp; For a quarter
of an hour afterwards she wouldn&rsquo;t look at me, but this
didn&rsquo;t prevent my asking her what had been the result, that
afternoon&mdash;in the Regent&rsquo;s Park, of her taking our
friend to see Miss Anvoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh so charming!&rdquo; she answered, brightening.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He said he recognised in her a nature he could absolutely
trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m speaking of the effect on
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
everything one could wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in her tone made me laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean
she gave him&mdash;a dole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you ask me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right there on the spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again poor Adelaide faltered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was to me of
course she gave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared; somehow I couldn&rsquo;t see the scene.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you mean a sum of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very handsome.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now at last she met
my eyes, though I could see it was with an effort.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thirty pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight out of her pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been
writing.&nbsp; She just slipped the folded notes into my
hand.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t looking; it was while he was going
back to the carriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said
Adelaide reassuringly, &ldquo;I take care of it for
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; The dear practical soul thought my agitation,
for I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the
money.&nbsp; Her disclosure made me for a moment muse violently,
and I dare say that during that moment I wondered if anything
else in the world makes people so gross as unselfishness.&nbsp; I
uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic cry, for she went on as
if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at such
passages.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assure you, my dear friend, he was in
one of his happy hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly indeed
these Americans!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;With her father in
the very act, as it were, of swindling her betrothed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mulville stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has
scarcely gone bankrupt&mdash;or whatever he has done&mdash;on
purpose.&nbsp; Very likely they won&rsquo;t be able to keep it
up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful
impulse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say Saltram was very fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond everything.&nbsp; He surprised even
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know what you&rsquo;ve enjoyed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a moment I added: &ldquo;Had he peradventure caught a
glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this my companion honestly flushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can
you be so cruel when you know how little he
calculates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, I do know it.&nbsp; But you tell me things
that act on my nerves.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure he hadn&rsquo;t
caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mulville brightly concurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;And perhaps
even of her beautiful listening face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps even!&nbsp; And what was it all
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His talk?&nbsp; It was apropos of her engagement, which
I had told him about: the idea of marriage, the philosophy, the
poetry, the sublimity of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was impossible
wholly to restrain one&rsquo;s mirth at this, and some rude
ripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It sounds a little stale, but you know his
freshness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of illustration?&nbsp; Indeed I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how he has always been right on that great
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what great question, dear lady, hasn&rsquo;t he been
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what other great men can you equally say
it?&mdash;and that he has never, but never, had a
deflexion?&rdquo; Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.</p>
<p>I tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction
in any less diffident way than by her charming present?&rdquo; I
was reduced to asking instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was
getting into the carriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words somehow
brushed up a picture of Saltram&rsquo;s big shawled back as he
hoisted himself into the green landau.&nbsp; &ldquo;She said she
wasn&rsquo;t disappointed,&rdquo; Adelaide pursued.</p>
<p>I turned it over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he wear his
shawl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His shawl?&rdquo;&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t even
noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked very nice, and you know he&rsquo;s really
clean.&nbsp; Miss Anvoy used such a remarkable
expression&mdash;she said his mind&rsquo;s like a
crystal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pricked up my ears.&nbsp; &ldquo;A crystal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspended in the moral world&mdash;swinging and shining
and flashing there.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s monstrously clever, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Monstrously!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">George Gravener</span> didn&rsquo;t follow
her, for late in September, after the House had risen, I met him
in a railway-carriage.&nbsp; He was coming up from Scotland and I
had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.&nbsp; The
current of travel back to London wasn&rsquo;t yet strong; at any
rate on entering the compartment I found he had had it for some
time to himself.&nbsp; We fared in company, and though he had a
blue-book in his lap and the open jaws of his bag threatened me
with the white teeth of confused papers, we inevitably, we even
at last sociably conversed.&nbsp; I saw things weren&rsquo;t well
with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by
himself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of
curiosity invidious.&nbsp; He mentioned that he was worried about
his good old friend Lady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be
detained some time in America, lay seriously ill at Clockborough,
much on his mind and on his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father has got into horrid straits&mdash;has lost
no end of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said:
&ldquo;I hope that raises no objection to your
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever; moreover it&rsquo;s my trade to meet
objections.&nbsp; But it may create tiresome delays, of which
there have been too many, from various causes, already.&nbsp;
Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.&nbsp; Then Mr.
Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his
back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s really in for some big
reverse.&nbsp; Lady Coxon&rsquo;s worse again, awfully upset by
the news from America, and she sends me word that she <i>must</i>
have Ruth.&nbsp; How can I supply her with Ruth?&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t got Ruth myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you haven&rsquo;t lost her?&rdquo; I
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s everything to her wretched father.&nbsp;
She writes me every post&mdash;telling me to smooth her
aunt&rsquo;s pillow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve other things to smooth; but
the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.&nbsp; She
won&rsquo;t receive her Coxon relations&mdash;she&rsquo;s angry
at so much of her money going to them.&nbsp; Besides, she&rsquo;s
hopelessly mad,&rdquo; said Gravener very frankly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember whether it was this, or what it was,
that made me ask if she hadn&rsquo;t such an appreciation of Mrs.
Saltram as might render that active person of some use.</p>
<p>He gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs.
Saltram into my head, and I replied that she was unfortunately
never out of it.&nbsp; I happened to remember the wonderful
accounts she had given me of the kindness Lady Coxon had shown
her.&nbsp; Gravener declared this to be false; Lady Coxon, who
didn&rsquo;t care for her, hadn&rsquo;t seen her three
times.&nbsp; The only foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who
used, poor girl, to chuck money about in a manner she must now
regret, had for an hour seen in the miserable woman&mdash;you
could never know what she&rsquo;d see in people&mdash;an
interesting pretext for the liberality with which her nature
overflowed.&nbsp; But even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of
her.&nbsp; Gravener told me more about the crash in New York and
the annoyance it had been to him, and we also glanced here and
there in other directions; but by the time we got to Doncaster
the principal thing he had let me see was that he was keeping
something back.&nbsp; We stopped at that station, and, at the
carriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.&nbsp; Gravener
uttered a sound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this
I should have had the secret.&nbsp; Then the intruder, for some
reason, spared us his company; we started afresh, and my hope of
a disclosure returned.&nbsp; My companion held his tongue,
however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I really dozed
for discouragement.&nbsp; When I reopened my eyes he was looking
at me with an injured air.&nbsp; He tossed away with some
vivacity the remnant of a cigarette and then said: &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re not too sleepy I want to put you a
case.&rdquo;&nbsp; I answered that I&rsquo;d make every effort to
attend, and welcomed the note of interest when he went on:
&ldquo;As I told you a while ago, Lady Coxon, poor dear, is
demented.&rdquo;&nbsp; His tone had much behind it&mdash;was full
of promise.&nbsp; I asked if her ladyship&rsquo;s misfortune were
a trait of her malady or only of her character, and he pronounced
it a product of both.&nbsp; The case he wanted to put to me was a
matter on which it concerned him to have the impression&mdash;the
judgement, he might also say&mdash;of another person.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take
what I can get.&rdquo; There would be the technical, the strictly
legal view; then there would be the way the question would strike
a man of the world.&nbsp; He had lighted another cigarette while
he talked, and I saw he was glad to have it to handle when he
brought out at last, with a laugh slightly artificial: &ldquo;In
fact it&rsquo;s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling
different ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want me to decide between you?&nbsp; I decide
in advance for Miss Anvoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In advance&mdash;that&rsquo;s quite right.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s how I decided when I proposed to her.&nbsp; But my
story will interest you only so far as your mind isn&rsquo;t made
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then
continued: &ldquo;Are you familiar with the idea of the Endowment
of Research?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Research?&rdquo; I was at sea a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you Lady Coxon&rsquo;s phrase.&nbsp; She has it
on the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wishes to endow&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some earnest and &lsquo;loyal&rsquo; seeker,&rdquo;
Gravener said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a sketchy design of her late
husband&rsquo;s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart in his
will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for
life, but of which, should she eventually see her
opportunity&mdash;the matter was left largely to her
discretion&mdash;she would best honour his memory by determining
the exemplary public use.&nbsp; This sum of money, no less than
thirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and
poor Sir Gregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon
Fund should cover his name with glory&mdash;be universally
desired and admired.&nbsp; He left his wife a full declaration of
his views, so far at least as that term may be applied to views
vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.&nbsp; A little
learning&rsquo;s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who
happens to have been an ass is worse for a community than bad
sewerage.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s worst of all when he&rsquo;s dead,
because then he can&rsquo;t be stopped.&nbsp; However, such as
they were, the poor man&rsquo;s aspirations are now in his
wife&rsquo;s bosom, or fermenting rather in her foolish brain: it
lies with her to carry them out.&nbsp; But of course she must
first catch her hare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her earnest loyal seeker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a
pecuniary independence as may aid the light that&rsquo;s in it to
shine upon the human race.&nbsp; The individual, in a word, who,
having the rest of the machinery, the spiritual, the
intellectual, is most hampered in his search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His search for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Moral Truth.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what Sir Gregory
calls it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I burst out laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Delightful munificent Sir
Gregory!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a charming idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Miss Anvoy thinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she a candidate for the Fund?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of&mdash;and she&rsquo;s perfectly
reasonable about it.&nbsp; But Lady Coxon has put the matter
before her, and we&rsquo;ve naturally had a lot of
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk that, as you&rsquo;ve so interestingly intimated,
has landed you in a disagreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She considers there&rsquo;s something in it,&rdquo;
Gravener said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you consider there&rsquo;s nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle&mdash;which
can&rsquo;t fail to be attended with consequences certainly
grotesque and possibly immoral.&nbsp; To begin with, fancy
constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal&mdash;a
bench of competent people, of judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And any one she chooses to invite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she has invited you,&rdquo; I noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not competent&mdash;I hate the thing.&nbsp;
Besides, she hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; my friend went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the
inspiration was originally Lady Coxon&rsquo;s own, that she
infected him with it, and that the flattering option left her is
simply his tribute to her beautiful, her aboriginal
enthusiasm.&nbsp; She came to England forty years ago, a thin
transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy
Clockborough marriage never really materialised her.&nbsp; She
feels indeed that she has become very British&mdash;as if that,
as a process, as a &lsquo;Werden,&rsquo; as anything but an
original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it&rsquo;s
precisely what makes her cling to the notion of the
&lsquo;Fund&rsquo;&mdash;cling to it as to a link with the
ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she cling if she&rsquo;s dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean how can she act in the matter?&rdquo;
Gravener asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely the
question.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t!&nbsp; As she has never yet
caught her hare, never spied out her lucky impostor&mdash;how
should she, with the life she has led?&mdash;her husband&rsquo;s
intention has come very near lapsing.&nbsp; His idea, to do him
justice, was that it <i>should</i> lapse if exactly the right
person, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should
fail to turn up.&nbsp; Ah the poor dear woman&rsquo;s very
particular&mdash;she says there must be no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found all this quite thrilling&mdash;I took it in with
avidity.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if she dies without doing anything,
what becomes of the money?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes back to his family, if she hasn&rsquo;t made
some other disposition of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may do that then&mdash;she may divert
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her hands are not tied.&nbsp; She has a grand
discretion.&nbsp; The proof is that three months ago she offered
to make the proceeds over to her niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s own use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s own use&mdash;on the occasion of
her prospective marriage.&nbsp; She was discouraged&mdash;the
earnest seeker required so earnest a search.&nbsp; She was afraid
of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed either
not earnest enough or not poor enough.&nbsp; On the receipt of
the first bad news about Mr. Anvoy&rsquo;s affairs she proposed
to Ruth to make the sacrifice for her.&nbsp; As the situation in
New York got worse she repeated her proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which Miss Anvoy declined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except as a formal trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean except as committing herself legally to place
the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the head of the deserving object, the great man
frustrated,&rdquo; said Gravener.&nbsp; &ldquo;She only consents
to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory&rsquo;s scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you blame her for that?&rdquo; I asked with some
intensity.</p>
<p>My tone couldn&rsquo;t have been harsh, but he coloured a
little and there was a queer light in his eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
dear fellow, if I &lsquo;blamed&rsquo; the young lady I&rsquo;m
engaged to I shouldn&rsquo;t immediately say it even to so old a
friend as you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I saw that some deep discomfort, some
restless desire to be sided with, reassuringly, approvingly
mirrored, had been at the bottom of his drifting so far, and I
was genuinely touched by his confidence.&nbsp; It was
inconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman
was not, for him, a habit: that itself was an
inconsistency.&nbsp; George Gravener could stand straight enough
before any other combination of forces.&nbsp; It amused me to
think that the combination he had succumbed to had an American
accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all my
old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I
could help him.&nbsp; I saw that I could from the insincere tone
in which he pursued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve criticised her of course,
I&rsquo;ve contended with her, and it has been great
fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet it clearly couldn&rsquo;t have been such
great fun as to make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss
Anvoy had nothing at all settled on herself.&nbsp; To this he
replied that she had only a trifle from her mother&mdash;a mere
four hundred a year, which was exactly why it would be convenient
to him that she shouldn&rsquo;t decline, in the face of this
total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would
distinctly help them to marry.&nbsp; When I enquired if there
were no other way in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt
could cause the weight of her benevolence to be felt, he answered
that Lady Coxon was affectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be
called rich.&nbsp; She could let her project of the Fund lapse
for her niece&rsquo;s benefit, but she couldn&rsquo;t do anything
else.&nbsp; She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously
provided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious
Coxons.&nbsp; She was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and
her conscience was now a distress to her, hovering round her bed
in irreconcilable forms of resentful husbands, portionless nieces
and undiscoverable philosophers.</p>
<p>We were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting
platforms, the multiplication of lights.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
you&rsquo;ll find,&rdquo; I said with a laugh, &ldquo;that your
predicament will disappear in the very fact that the philosopher
<i>is</i> undiscoverable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to gather up his papers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who can set a
limit to the ingenuity of an extravagant woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, after all, who indeed?&rdquo; I echoed as I
recalled the extravagance commemorated in Adelaide&rsquo;s
anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.</p>
<h2><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thing I had been most sensible
of in that talk with George Gravener was the way Saltram&rsquo;s
name kept out of it.&nbsp; It seemed to me at the time that we
were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared
more probable there had been on my companion&rsquo;s part no
conscious avoidance.&nbsp; Later on I was sure of this, and for
the best of reasons&mdash;the simple reason of my perceiving more
completely that, for evil as well as for good, he said nothing to
Gravener&rsquo;s imagination.&nbsp; That honest man didn&rsquo;t
fear him&mdash;he was too much disgusted with him.&nbsp; No more
did I, doubtless, and for very much the same reason.&nbsp; I
treated my friend&rsquo;s story as an absolute confidence; but
when before Christmas, by Mrs. Saltram, I was informed of Lady
Coxon&rsquo;s death without having had news of Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s
return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no more
of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I
had never <i>too</i> disconcertedly believed.&nbsp; I began to
ask myself how people who suited each other so little could
please each other so much.&nbsp; The charm was some material
charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet superficial some
surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and grace and
fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.&nbsp; They might dote
on each other&rsquo;s persons, but how could they know each
other&rsquo;s souls?&nbsp; How could they have the same
prejudices, how could they have the same horizon?&nbsp; Such
questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered when, one
day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady
in the house.&nbsp; A passion that had brought her back across
the wintry ocean was as much of a passion as was needed.&nbsp; No
impulse equally strong indeed had drawn George Gravener to
America; a circumstance on which, however, I reflected only long
enough to remind myself that it was none of my business.&nbsp;
Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the
difference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.&nbsp;
Mrs. Mulville told me soon enough what it was: it was the
difference between a handsome girl with large expectations and a
handsome girl with only four hundred a year.&nbsp; This
explanation indeed didn&rsquo;t wholly content me, not even when
I learned that her mourning had a double cause&mdash;learned that
poor Mr. Anvoy, giving way altogether, buried under the ruins of
his fortune and leaving next to nothing, had died a few weeks
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she has come out to marry George Gravener?&rdquo; I
commented.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been prettier of
him to have saved her the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t the House just met?&rdquo; Adelaide
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And for Mr. Gravener the
House&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she added: &ldquo;I gather that
her having come is exactly a sign that the marriage is a little
shaky.&nbsp; If it were quite all right a self-respecting girl
like Ruth would have waited for him over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I
said was: &ldquo;Do you mean she&rsquo;ll have had to return to
<i>make</i> it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason
independent of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Adelaide could only surmise,
however, as yet, and there was more, as we found, to be
revealed.&nbsp; Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival, had
brought the young lady out in the green landau for the
Sunday.&nbsp; The Coxons were in possession of the house in
Regent&rsquo;s Park, and Miss Anvoy was in dreary lodgings.&nbsp;
George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide called, but had
assented graciously enough to the little visit at
Wimbledon.&nbsp; The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not
mentioned, had been sent off on some errand from which it was to
return and pick the ladies up.&nbsp; Gravener had left them
together, and at the end of an hour, on the Saturday afternoon,
the party of three had driven out to Wimbledon.&nbsp; This was
the girl&rsquo;s second glimpse of our great man, and I was
interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the
first appeared to have been confirmed.&nbsp; On her replying
after consideration, that of course with time and opportunity it
couldn&rsquo;t fail to be, but that she was disappointed, I was
sufficiently struck with her use of this last word to question
her further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;re disappointed because you judge
Miss Anvoy to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.&nbsp;
We had two or three people, but he scarcely opened his
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all the better to-night,&rdquo; I opined
after a moment.&nbsp; Then I pursued: &ldquo;What particular
importance do you attach to the idea of her being
impressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my
levity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why the importance of her being as happy as
<i>we</i> are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that at this my levity grew.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
that&rsquo;s a happiness almost too great to wish a
person!&rdquo;&nbsp; I saw she hadn&rsquo;t yet in her mind what
I had in mine, and at any rate the visitor&rsquo;s actual bliss
was limited to a walk in the garden with Kent Mulville.&nbsp;
Later in the afternoon I also took one, and I saw nothing of Miss
Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of the company of Saltram,
who had caused it to be reported that he was indisposed and lying
down.&nbsp; This made us, most of us&mdash;for there were other
friends present&mdash;convey to each other in silence some of the
unutterable things that in those years our eyes had inevitably
acquired the art of expressing.&nbsp; If a fine little American
enquirer hadn&rsquo;t been there we would have expressed them
otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended not to hear.&nbsp; I
had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself nobly; and I
knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants, managing,
dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him
bodily to his room.&nbsp; Just recently he had been so wise and
so deep and so high that I had begun to get nervous&mdash;to
wonder if by chance there were something behind it, if he were
kept straight for instance by the knowledge that the hated
Pudneys would have more to tell us if they chose.&nbsp; He was
lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us in this
connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest
pools.&nbsp; We should have had a merry life indeed if all the
splashes had sprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were
even then to feel about our ears.&nbsp; Kent Mulville had been up
to his room, but had come back with a face that told as few tales
as I had seen it succeed in telling on the evening I waited in
the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.&nbsp; I said to myself that our
friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the presence of a
comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of suggesting
to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying possibilities
in which we didn&rsquo;t ourselves believe.&nbsp; At ten
o&rsquo;clock he came into the drawing-room with his waistcoat
much awry but his eyes sending out great signals.&nbsp; It was
precisely with his entrance that I ceased to be vividly conscious
of him.&nbsp; I saw that the crystal, as I had called it, had
begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention for Miss
Anvoy.</p>
<p>Even when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have
said to-day, broken the record, the manner in which that
attention had been rewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.&nbsp;
I had of course a perfect general consciousness that something
great was going on: it was a little like having been etherised to
hear Herr Joachim play.&nbsp; The old music was in the air; I
felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the flight,
the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the
listeners that nobody else knew, and Saltram&rsquo;s monologue
could reach me only through that medium.&nbsp; To this hour
I&rsquo;m of no use when, as a witness, I&rsquo;m appealed
to&mdash;for they still absurdly contend about it&mdash;as to
whether or no on that historic night he was drunk; and my
position is slightly ridiculous, for I&rsquo;ve never cared to
tell them what it really was I was taken up with.&nbsp; What I
got out of it is the only morsel of the total experience that is
quite my own.&nbsp; The others were shared, but this is
incommunicable.&nbsp; I feel that now, I&rsquo;m bound to say,
even in thus roughly evoking the occasion, and it takes something
from my pride of clearness.&nbsp; However, I shall perhaps be as
clear as is absolutely needful if I remark that our young lady
was too much given up to her own intensity of observation to be
sensible of mine.&nbsp; It was plainly not the question of her
marriage that had brought her back.&nbsp; I greatly enjoyed this
discovery and was sure that had that question alone been involved
she would have stirred no step.&nbsp; In this case doubtless
Gravener would, in spite of the House of Commons, have found
means to rejoin her.&nbsp; It afterwards made me uncomfortable
for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put before
me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting
for her fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her
having gone to stay at Coldfield.&nbsp; If she was in England at
all while the engagement stood the only proper place for her was
under Lady Maddock&rsquo;s wing.&nbsp; Now that she was
unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective
sister-in-law would be wholly won over.</p>
<p>There would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her
behaviour, as I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that
had taken birth in my mind, to my private amusement, while that
other night I listened to George Gravener in the
railway-carriage.&nbsp; I watched her in the light of this queer
possibility&mdash;a formidable thing certainly to meet&mdash;and
I was aware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my
interpretation of her very looks and tones.&nbsp; At Wimbledon
for instance it had appeared to me she was literally afraid of
Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had begun already to
feel.&nbsp; I had come up to town with her the next day and had
been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely
on her guard.&nbsp; She would show as little as possible before
she should be ready to show everything.&nbsp; What this final
exhibition might be on the part of a girl perceptibly so able to
think things out I found it great sport to forecast.&nbsp; It
would have been exciting to be approached by her, appealed to by
her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn&rsquo;t find
myself in such a predicament.&nbsp; If there was really a present
rigour in the situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the
elements, she would have to get out of her difficulty by
herself.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t I who had launched her and it
wasn&rsquo;t I who could help her.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t fail to
ask myself why, since I couldn&rsquo;t help her, I should think
so much about her.&nbsp; It was in part my suspense that was
responsible for this; I waited impatiently to see whether she
wouldn&rsquo;t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion at least of what
I had learned from Gravener.&nbsp; But I saw Mrs. Mulville was
still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she
hadn&rsquo;t come as a conciliatory bride.&nbsp; That she had
come in some other character was the only thing that fitted all
the appearances.&nbsp; Having for family reasons to spend some
time that spring in the west of England, I was in a manner out of
earshot of the great oceanic rumble&mdash;I mean of the
continuous hum of Saltram&rsquo;s thought&mdash;and my uneasiness
tended to keep me quiet.&nbsp; There was something I wanted so
little to have to say that my prudence surmounted my
curiosity.&nbsp; I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked over the
idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why I
didn&rsquo;t hear from Wimbledon.&nbsp; I had a reproachful note
about something or other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no
mention of Lady Coxon&rsquo;s niece, on whom her eyes had been
much less fixed since the recent untoward events.</p>
<h2><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Adelaide&rsquo;s silence was
fully explained later&mdash;practically explained when in June,
returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman with
an early visit.&nbsp; As soon as she arrived I guessed
everything, and as soon as she told me that darling Ruth had been
in her house nearly a month I had my question ready.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What in the name of maidenly modesty is she staying in
England for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she loves me so!&rdquo; cried Adelaide
gaily.&nbsp; But she hadn&rsquo;t come to see me only to tell me
Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently established,
and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener had now
raised an objection to it.&nbsp; He had protested at least
against her being at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his
heart he had originally brought her himself; he called on her to
put an end to their engagement in the only proper, the only happy
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why in the world doesn&rsquo;t she do do?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>Adelaide had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;She says you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then on my also hesitating she added: &ldquo;A condition he
makes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Coxon Fund?&rdquo; I panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has mentioned to her his having told you about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah but so little!&nbsp; Do you mean she has accepted
the trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the most splendid spirit&mdash;as a duty about which
there can be no two opinions.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which my friend
added: &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s thinking of Mr.
Saltram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my
visitor turn pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;How very awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to have anything to do with such an idea
one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure <i>you</i> needn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and
Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t good enough!&rdquo; I went on; to which
she opposed a sound almost as contentious as my own had
been.&nbsp; This made me, with genuine immediate horror, exclaim:
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t influenced her, I hope!&rdquo; and my
emphasis brought back the blood with a rush to poor
Adelaide&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; She declared while she
blushed&mdash;for I had frightened her again&mdash;that she had
never influenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and
heard and judged for herself.&nbsp; <i>He</i> had influenced her,
if I would, as he did every one who had a soul: that word, as we
knew, even expressed feebly the power of the things he said to
haunt the mind.&nbsp; How could she, Adelaide, help it if Miss
Anvoy&rsquo;s mind was haunted?&nbsp; I demanded with a groan
what right a pretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to
<i>have</i> a mind; but the only explanation my bewildered friend
could give me was that she was so clever.&nbsp; She regarded Mr.
Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for good.&nbsp; She was
intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough to
admire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s many things enough, but is she, among them,
rich enough?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rich enough, I mean,
to sacrifice such a lot of good money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for herself to judge.&nbsp; Besides,
it&rsquo;s not her own money; she doesn&rsquo;t in the least
consider it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Gravener does, if not <i>his</i> own; and
that&rsquo;s the whole difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had
absolutely to see her poor aunt&rsquo;s solicitor.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s clear that by Lady Coxon&rsquo;s will she may have the
money, but it&rsquo;s still clearer to her conscience that the
original condition, definite, intensely implied on her
uncle&rsquo;s part, is attached to the use of it.&nbsp; She can
only take one view of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s for the Endowment or
it&rsquo;s for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Endowment,&rdquo; I permitted myself to observe,
&ldquo;is a conception superficially sublime, but fundamentally
ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you repeating Mr. Gravener&rsquo;s words?&rdquo;
Adelaide asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, though I&rsquo;ve not seen him for
months.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simply the way it strikes me too.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s an old wife&rsquo;s tale.&nbsp; Gravener made some
reference to the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose
arrangement has <i>no</i> legal aspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth doesn&rsquo;t insist on that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Mulville; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s, for her, exactly this technical
weakness that constitutes the force of the moral
obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you repeating <i>her</i> words?&rdquo; I
enquired.&nbsp; I forget what else Adelaide said, but she said
she was magnificent.&nbsp; I thought of George Gravener
confronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could
have made two such persons ever suppose they understood each
other.&nbsp; Mrs. Mulville assured me the girl loved him as such
a woman could love and that she suffered as such a woman could
suffer.&nbsp; Nevertheless she wanted to see <i>me</i>.&nbsp; At
this I sprang up with a groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m so
sorry!&mdash;when?&rdquo;&nbsp; Small though her sense of humour,
I think Adelaide laughed at my sequence.&nbsp; We discussed the
day, the nearest it would be convenient I should come out; but
before she went I asked my visitor how long she had been
acquainted with these prodigies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several weeks, but I was pledged to
secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why you didn&rsquo;t write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t very well tell you she was with me
without telling you that no time had even yet been fixed for her
marriage.&nbsp; And I couldn&rsquo;t very well tell you as much
as that without telling you what I knew of the reason of
it.&nbsp; It was not till a day or two ago,&rdquo; Mrs. Mulville
went on, &ldquo;that she asked me to ask you if you
wouldn&rsquo;t come and see her.&nbsp; Then at last she spoke of
your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned this over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why on earth does she want to
see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To talk with you, naturally, about Mr.
Saltram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a subject for the prize?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
hugely obvious, and I presently returned: &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;ll sail to-morrow for Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then&mdash;sail!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mulville,
getting up.</p>
<p>But I frivolously, continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;On Thursday at
five, we said?&rdquo;&nbsp; The appointment was made definite and
I enquired how, all this time, the unconscious candidate had
carried himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he
has positively been a dear.&nbsp; And then, as to what we revere
him for, in the most wonderful form.&nbsp; His very
highest&mdash;pure celestial light.&nbsp; You <i>won&rsquo;t</i>
do him an ill turn?&rdquo; Adelaide pleaded at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What danger can equal for him the danger to which
he&rsquo;s exposed from himself?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition
that will make an Endowment a scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scandal?&rdquo; Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my
carpet.&nbsp; &ldquo;He grows bigger every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do you!&rdquo; I laughed as she went off.</p>
<p>That girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than
justified my apprehensions.&nbsp; I recognised fully now the
cause of the agitation she had produced in me from the
first&mdash;the faint foreknowledge that there was something very
stiff I should have to do for her.&nbsp; I felt more than ever
committed to my fate as, standing before her in the big
drawing-room where they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I
tried with a smile to string together the pearls of lucidity
which, from her chair, she successively tossed me.&nbsp; Pale and
bright, in her monotonous mourning, she was an image of
intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked myself
whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that
which permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her
difficulty, into the priggish old room.&nbsp; This remarkable
young woman could be earnest without being solemn, and at moments
when I ought doubtless to have cursed her obstinacy I found
myself watching the unstudied play of her eyebrows or the
recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by the
parting of her lips.&nbsp; These aberrations, I hasten to add,
didn&rsquo;t prevent my learning soon enough why she had wished
to see me.&nbsp; Her reason for this was as distinct as her
beauty: it was to make me explain what I had meant, on the
occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram&rsquo;s want of
dignity.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t that she couldn&rsquo;t imagine,
but she desired it there from my lips.&nbsp; What she really
desired of course was to know whether there was worse about him
than what she had found out for herself.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t
been a month so much in the house with him without discovering
that he wasn&rsquo;t a man of monumental bronze.&nbsp; He was
like a jelly minus its mould, he had to be embanked; and that was
precisely the source of her interest in him and the ground of her
project.&nbsp; She put her project boldly before me: there it
stood in its preposterous beauty.&nbsp; She was as willing to
take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only difference
was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn&rsquo;t
necessarily prohibitive, wasn&rsquo;t paralysing.</p>
<p>Moreover she professed that she couldn&rsquo;t discuss with me
the primary question&mdash;the moral obligation: that was in her
own breast.&nbsp; There were things she couldn&rsquo;t go
into&mdash;injunctions, impressions she had received.&nbsp; They
were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her
aunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of
delicacy, the interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had
always in the last resort to make up one&rsquo;s mind for
one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp; It was the idea of the application to the
particular case, such a splendid one at last, that troubled her,
and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple
matter; if it <i>had</i> been she wouldn&rsquo;t have attempted
to saddle me with any portion of it.&nbsp; The Mulvilles were
sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?&nbsp; Could
they indeed be, in their position&mdash;would it even have been
to be desired?&nbsp; Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than
that of me&mdash;whether there was anything dreadful kept
back.&nbsp; She made no allusion whatever to George
Gravener&mdash;I thought her silence the only good taste and her
gaiety perhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the
effect of a determination that people shouldn&rsquo;t know from
herself that her relations with the man she was to marry were
strained.&nbsp; All the weight, however, that she left me to
throw was a sufficient implication of the weight <i>he</i> had
thrown in vain.&nbsp; Oh she knew the question of character was
immense, and that one couldn&rsquo;t entertain any plan for
making merit comfortable without running the gauntlet of that
terrible procession of interrogation-points which, like a young
ladies&rsquo; school out for a walk, hooked their uniform noses
at the tail of governess Conduct.&nbsp; But were we absolutely to
hold that there was never, never, never an exception, never,
never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever
charity, for suspended pedantry&mdash;for letting one side, in
short, outbalance another?&nbsp; When Miss Anvoy threw off this
appeal I could have embraced her for so delightfully emphasising
her unlikeness to Mrs. Saltram.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not have the
courage of one&rsquo;s forgiveness,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;as
well as the enthusiasm of one&rsquo;s adhesion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing how wonderfully you&rsquo;ve threshed the whole
thing out,&rdquo; I evasively replied, &ldquo;gives me an
extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm has
reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine,
and I divined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a
reference to some personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to
some aberration of sensibility, some perversion of taste.&nbsp;
At least I couldn&rsquo;t interpret otherwise the sudden flash
that came into her face.&nbsp; Such a manifestation, as the
result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but while I was
thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile of
exquisite good nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh you see one forgets so
wonderfully how one dislikes him!&rdquo; she said; and if her
tone simply extinguished his strange figure with the brush of its
compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day as the purest of all
our praises.&nbsp; But with what quick response of fine pity such
a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh &ldquo;Ah
poor Saltram!&rdquo;&nbsp; She instantly, with this, took the
measure of all I didn&rsquo;t believe, and it enabled her to go
on: &ldquo;What can one do when a person has given such a lift to
one&rsquo;s interest in life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what can one do?&rdquo;&nbsp; If I struck her as a
little vague it was because I was thinking of another
person.&nbsp; I indulged in another inarticulate
murmur&mdash;&ldquo;Poor George Gravener!&rdquo;&nbsp; What had
become of the lift <i>he</i> had given that interest?&nbsp; Later
on I made up my mind that she was sore and stricken at the
appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.&nbsp;
This was the hidden reason of her alienation.&nbsp; The probable
sincerity, in spite of the illiberality, of his scruples about
the particular use of it under discussion didn&rsquo;t efface the
ugliness of his demand that they should buy a good house with
it.&nbsp; Then, as for <i>his</i> alienation, he didn&rsquo;t,
pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her
interest in life.&nbsp; If a mere spectator could ask that last
question, with what rage in his heart the man himself
might!&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t, like her, I was to see, too proud
to show me why he was disappointed.</p>

93</span>XI</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> unable this time to stay to
dinner: such at any rate was the plea on which I took
leave.&nbsp; I desired in truth to get away from my young lady,
for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.&nbsp;
How <i>could</i> I satisfy her?&nbsp; I asked myself&mdash;how
could I tell her how much had been kept back?&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t even know and I certainly didn&rsquo;t desire to
know.&nbsp; My own policy had ever been to learn the least about
poor Saltram&rsquo;s weaknesses&mdash;not to learn the
most.&nbsp; A great deal that I had in fact learned had been
forced upon me by his wife.&nbsp; There was something even
irritating in Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s crude conscientiousness, and I
wondered why, after all, she couldn&rsquo;t have let him alone
and been content to entrust George Gravener with the purchase of
the good house.&nbsp; I was sure he would have driven a bargain,
got something excellent and cheap.&nbsp; I laughed louder even
than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I must think
over her case.&nbsp; I professed a horror of responsibilities and
twitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t really that I was afraid of the scandal, the moral
discredit for the Fund; what troubled me most was a feeling of a
different order.&nbsp; Of course, as the beneficiary of the Fund
was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was hoped that new
beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be a trifle that the first of these worthies
shouldn&rsquo;t have been a striking example of the domestic
virtues.&nbsp; The Fund would start badly, as it were, and the
laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be greener from
the brows of the original wearer.&nbsp; That idea, however, was
at that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it
ought perhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of
Saltram&rsquo;s getting the money than that of this exalted young
woman&rsquo;s giving it up.&nbsp; I wanted her to have it for
herself, and I told her so before I went away.&nbsp; She looked
graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she hoped such
a preference wouldn&rsquo;t make me dishonest.</p>
<p>It made me, to begin with, very restless&mdash;made me,
instead of going straight to the station, fidget a little about
that many-coloured Common which gives Wimbledon horizons.&nbsp;
There was a worry for me to work off, or rather keep at a
distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I had, in
Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s phrase, been saddled with it.&nbsp; What could
have been clearer indeed than the attitude of recognising
perfectly what a world of trouble The Coxon Fund would in future
save us, and of yet liking better to face a continuance of that
trouble than see, and in fact contribute to, a deviation from
attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in whom I was
deeply interested?&nbsp; Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,
there was projected across this clearness the image of a massive
middle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad
far-wandering eyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a
stick&mdash;a stick I recognised, a stout gold-headed staff that
I had given him in devoted days.&nbsp; I stopped short as he
turned his face to me, and it happened that for some reason or
other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the beauty of
his rich blank gaze.&nbsp; It was charged with experience as the
sky is charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had
been overspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or
the great dome of a temple.&nbsp; Doubtless I was rendered
peculiarly sensitive to it by something in the way I had been
giving him up and sinking him.&nbsp; While I met it I stood there
smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a sort of guilty
grimace.&nbsp; This brought back his attention in a smile which
expressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble
gentleness.&nbsp; I had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity,
but what did he seem to me, all unbuttoned and fatigued as he
waited for me to come up, if he didn&rsquo;t seem unconcerned
with small things, didn&rsquo;t seem in short majestic?&nbsp;
There was majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little
conferences and puzzlements over his maintenance and his
reward.</p>
<p>After I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his
big soft shoulder&mdash;wherever you touched him you found
equally little firmness&mdash;and said in a tone of which the
suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: &ldquo;Come back to town
with me, old friend&mdash;come back and spend the
evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him,
and at Waterloo, an hour later, I telegraphed possessively to the
Mulvilles.&nbsp; When he objected, as regards staying all night,
that he had no things, I asked him if he hadn&rsquo;t everything
of mine.&nbsp; I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it was
too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea
and fried fish at my rooms&mdash;reduced also to the
transcendent.&nbsp; Something had come up which made me want him
to feel at peace with me&mdash;and which, precisely, was all the
dear man himself wanted on any occasion.&nbsp; I had too often
had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives me
pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I
didn&rsquo;t even mention Mrs. Saltram and the children.&nbsp;
Late into the night we smoked and talked; old shames and old
rigours fell away from us; I only let him see that I was
conscious of what I owed him.&nbsp; He was as mild as contrition
and as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return,
and even better at forgiving than at being forgiven.&nbsp; I dare
say it was a smaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon,
the night of the problematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s
initiation; but I was as much in it on this occasion as I had
been out of it then.&nbsp; At about 1.30 he was sublime.</p>
<p>He never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings
were over, and his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the
principal reason mentioned by departing cooks.&nbsp; The coast
was therefore clear for me to receive her when, early the next
morning, to my surprise, it was announced to me his wife had
called.&nbsp; I hesitated, after she had come up, about telling
her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the
question, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter
which, looking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a
pregnant absence of comment, in my hand.&nbsp; For a single
moment there glimmered before me the fond hope that Mrs. Saltram
had tendered me, as it were, her resignation and desired to
embody the act in an unsparing form.&nbsp; To bring this about I
would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had caught
the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that
betrayed a sense of something very different from relief:
&ldquo;Oh the Pudneys!&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew their envelopes though
they didn&rsquo;t know mine.&nbsp; They always used the kind sold
at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as this letter
hadn&rsquo;t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.&nbsp; I
had seen their horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn&rsquo;t
been in direct correspondence with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.&nbsp; They
doubtless explain to you that they hadn&rsquo;t your
address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned the thing over without opening it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
in the world should they write to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;ve something to tell you.&nbsp; The
worst,&rdquo; Mrs. Saltram dryly added.</p>
<p>It was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their
lamentable quarrel with her husband, the episode in which,
vindictively, disingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one
had to admit that he had put himself more grossly in the wrong
than at any moment of his life.&nbsp; He had begun by insulting
the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious protectors, and
then, according to his wont at the end of a few months, had dug a
still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left yawning
behind.&nbsp; The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed;
but the Pudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the
nastiest fire.&nbsp; I never doubted they had a strong case, and
I had been from the first for not defending him&mdash;reasoning
that if they weren&rsquo;t contradicted they&rsquo;d perhaps
subside.&nbsp; This was above all what I wanted, and I so far
prevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save
our little circle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would
have borne.&nbsp; I knew, that is I divined, that their
allegations had gone as yet only as far as their courage,
conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed place in
which Saltram could have planted a blow.&nbsp; It was a question
with them whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would
dare his blow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner
afraid of each other.&nbsp; I judged that on the day the Pudneys
should cease for some reason or other to be afraid they would
treat us to some revelation more disconcerting than any of its
predecessors.&nbsp; As I held Mrs. Saltram&rsquo;s letter in my
hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had
come&mdash;they had ceased to be afraid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to know the worst,&rdquo; I presently
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to open the letter.&nbsp; It also
contains an enclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt it&mdash;it was fat and uncanny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wheels
within wheels!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something for me too to deliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they tell me&mdash;to Miss Anvoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared; I felt a certain thrill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t they send it to her directly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Saltram hung fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s
staying with Mr. and Mrs. Mulville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should that prevent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the
grotesque, the unconscious perversity of her action.&nbsp; I was
the only person save George Gravener and the Mulvilles who was
aware of Sir Gregory Coxon&rsquo;s and of Miss Anvoy&rsquo;s
strange bounty.&nbsp; Where could there have been a more signal
illustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having
complacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the chance of their seeing her
letters.&nbsp; They know Mr. Pudney&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still I didn&rsquo;t understand; then it flashed upon
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean they might intercept it?&nbsp; How can
you imply anything so base?&rdquo; I indignantly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not I&mdash;it&rsquo;s Mr. Pudney!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his own
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why couldn&rsquo;t he send the letter to you to be
delivered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Saltram&rsquo;s embarrassment increased; she gave me
another hard look.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must make that out for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made it out quickly enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
denunciation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real lady doesn&rsquo;t betray her husband!&rdquo;
this virtuous woman exclaimed.</p>
<p>I burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an
effect of impertinence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Especially to Miss Anvoy,
who&rsquo;s so easily shocked? Why do such things concern
<i>her</i>?&rdquo; I asked, much at a loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s there, exposed to all his
craft.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have been watching this: they
feel she may be taken in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for all the rest of us!&nbsp; What difference
can it make when she has lost her power to contribute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: &ldquo;There
are other things in the world than money.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
hadn&rsquo;t occurred to her so long as the young lady had any;
but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that Mr. and Mrs.
Pudney doubtless explained their motives.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all in kindness,&rdquo; she continued as she got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindness to Miss Anvoy?&nbsp; You took, on the whole,
another view of kindness before her reverses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My companion smiled with some acidity &ldquo;Perhaps
you&rsquo;re no safer than the Mulvilles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want her to think that, nor that she should
report to the Pudneys that they had not been happy in their
agent; and I well remember that this was the moment at which I
began, with considerable emotion, to promise myself to enjoin
upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that should come to her
in one of those penny envelopes.&nbsp; My emotion, and I fear I
must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have
been as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some
diplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s best you should take <i>my</i> view of my
safety,&rdquo; I at any rate soon responded.&nbsp; When I saw she
didn&rsquo;t know what I meant by this I added: &ldquo;You may
turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing
you&rsquo;ll profoundly regret.&rdquo;&nbsp; My tone had a
significance which, I could see, did make her uneasy, and there
was a moment, after I had made two or three more remarks of
studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed so
hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I
emphasised them that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney&rsquo;s
communication into my pocket.&nbsp; She looked, in her
embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it to send it back to
him.&nbsp; I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost given
her my word I wouldn&rsquo;t deliver the enclosure.&nbsp; The
passionate movement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I
transferred the whole thing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer
which I double-locked would have amounted, for an initiated
observer, to some such pledge.</p>
<h2><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>XII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Saltram</span> left me drawing my
breath more quickly and indeed almost in pain&mdash;as if I had
just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t quite know what it was&mdash;it had a shocking
resemblance to my honour.&nbsp; The emotion was the livelier
surely in that my pulses even yet vibrated to the pleasure with
which, the night before, I had rallied to the rare analyst, the
great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.&nbsp; What had
dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared
before me in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to
haggle over his value.&nbsp; Hang it, one had to choose, one had
to put that value somewhere; so I would put it really high and
have done with it.&nbsp; Mrs. Mulville drove in for him at a
discreet hour&mdash;the earliest she could suppose him to have
got up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had
she not been expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.&nbsp; I was
perfectly mindful that I was under bonds to see this young lady,
and also that I had a letter to hand to her; but I took my time,
I waited from day to day.&nbsp; I left Mrs. Saltram to deal as
her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.&nbsp; I knew at
last what I meant&mdash;I had ceased to wince at my
responsibility.&nbsp; I gave this supreme impression of Saltram
time to fade if it would; but it didn&rsquo;t fade, and,
individually, it hasn&rsquo;t faded even now.&nbsp; During the
month that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide
Mulville, perplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I
<i>was</i> so stiff.&nbsp; At that season of the year I was
usually oftener &ldquo;with&rdquo; them.&nbsp; She also wrote
that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr.
Gravener and her sweet young friend&mdash;a state of things but
half satisfactory to her so long as the advantage resulting to
Mr. Saltram failed to disengage itself from the merely nebulous
state.&nbsp; She intimated that her sweet young friend was, if
anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated that there
might now be an opening for another clever young man.&nbsp; There
never was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of
course the question can&rsquo;t come up to-day.&nbsp; These are
old frustrations now.&nbsp; Ruth Anvoy hasn&rsquo;t married, I
hear, and neither have I.&nbsp; During the month, toward the end,
I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special errand, I
might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very next
day at my door.&nbsp; I saw he had immediately connected my
enquiry with the talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his
promptitude showed that the ashes of his eagerness weren&rsquo;t
yet cold.&nbsp; I told him there was something I felt I ought in
candour to let him know&mdash;I recognised the obligation his
friendly confidence had laid on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?&nbsp; She has
told me so herself,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t to tell you so that I wanted to see
you,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;for it seemed to me that such a
communication would rest wholly with herself.&nbsp; If however
she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you I
was discouraging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discouraging?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the subject of a present application of The Coxon
Fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the case of Mr. Saltram?&nbsp; My dear fellow, I
don&rsquo;t know what you call discouraging!&rdquo; Gravener
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe she did, but such a thing&rsquo;s measured by
the effect.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not
&lsquo;discouraged,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her own affair.&nbsp; The reason I asked
you to see me was that it appeared to me I ought to tell you
frankly that&mdash;decidedly!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t undertake to
produce that effect.&nbsp; In fact I don&rsquo;t want
to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you, damn you!&rdquo; my
visitor laughed, red and really grave.&nbsp; Then he said:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to see that scoundrel publicly
glorified&mdash;perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary
pension?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I braced myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Taking one form of public
recognition with another it seems to me on the whole I should be
able to bear it.&nbsp; When I see the compliments that <i>are</i>
paid right and left I ask myself why this one shouldn&rsquo;t
take its course.&nbsp; This therefore is what you&rsquo;re
entitled to have looked to me to mention to you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
some evidence that perhaps would be really dissuasive, but I
propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain in ignorance of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to invite me to do the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you don&rsquo;t require it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
evidence enough.&nbsp; I speak of a sealed letter that I&rsquo;ve
been requested to deliver to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t mean to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one consideration that would make
me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Gravener&rsquo;s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a
minute, but evidently without fishing up a clue to this
motive&mdash;a failure by which I was almost wounded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What does the letter contain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sealed, as I tell you, and I don&rsquo;t
know what it contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it sent through you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather than you?&rdquo; I wondered how to put the
thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The only explanation I can think of is that
the person sending it may have imagined your relations with Miss
Anvoy to be at an end&mdash;may have been told this is the case
by Mrs. Saltram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,&rdquo;
poor Gravener stammered.</p>
<p>Again for an instant I thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;The offer I
propose to make you gives me the right to address you a question
remarkably direct.&nbsp; Are you still engaged to Miss
Anvoy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he slowly brought out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re perfectly good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such good friends that you&rsquo;ll again become
prospective husband and wife if the obstacle in your path be
removed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Removed?&rdquo; he anxiously repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give
up her idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for God&rsquo;s sake send it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do so if you&rsquo;re ready to assure me
that her sacrifice would now presumably bring about your
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d marry her the next day!&rdquo; my visitor
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but would she marry <i>you</i>?&nbsp; What I ask
of you of course is nothing less than your word of honour as to
your conviction of this.&nbsp; If you give it me,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll engage to hand her the letter before
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he
stood looking a moment hard at its unruffled perfection.&nbsp;
Then very angrily honestly and gallantly, &ldquo;Hand it to the
devil!&rdquo; he broke out; with which he clapped the hat on his
head and left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you read it or not?&rdquo; I said to Ruth Anvoy,
at Wimbledon, when I had told her the story of Mrs.
Saltram&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>She debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long
enough to make me nervous.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you brought it with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s at home, locked
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another great silence, and then she said &ldquo;Go
back and destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went back, but I didn&rsquo;t destroy it till after
Saltram&rsquo;s death, when I burnt it unread.&nbsp; The Pudneys
approached her again pressingly, but, prompt as they were, The
Coxon Fund had already become an operative benefit and a general
amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it were, to watch
the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent
income.&nbsp; He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with
a grand abstracted gesture.&nbsp; Its magnificence, alas, as all
the world now knows, quite quenched him; it was the beginning of
his decline.&nbsp; It was also naturally a new grievance for his
wife, who began to believe in him as soon as he was blighted, and
who at this hour accuses us of having bribed him, on the whim of
a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious office, to
become, as she says, like everybody else.&nbsp; The very day he
found himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.&nbsp;
This deprived us, as may easily be imagined, of much of our
occupation, and especially deprived the Mulvilles, whose want of
self-support I never measured till they lost their great
inmate.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve no one to live on now.&nbsp;
Adelaide&rsquo;s most frequent reference to their destitution is
embodied in the remark that dear far-away Ruth&rsquo;s intentions
were doubtless good.&nbsp; She and Kent are even yet looking for
another prop, but no one presents a true sphere of
usefulness.&nbsp; They complain that people are
self-sufficing.&nbsp; With Saltram the fine type of the child of
adoption was scattered, the grander, the elder style.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve got their carriage back, but what&rsquo;s an empty
carriage?&nbsp; In short I think we were all happier as well as
poorer before; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths
of his brother and his nephew has lately become Lord
Maddock.&nbsp; His wife, whose fortune clears the property, is
criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper House, and
hasn&rsquo;t yet had high office.&nbsp; But what are these
accidents, which I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in
the light of the great eventual boon promised the patient by the
rate at which The Coxon Fund must be rolling up?</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
